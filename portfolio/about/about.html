        collegiate basketball is what drives me in this field. 
        From the basketball court to coding, my genuine yearn for competition and drive for excellence remain unchanged. 
        Just as I trained hard on the court, I approach coding challenges with the same dedication and teamwork mentality. 
        The rush of problem-solving as a software engineer mirrors the thrill of a game-winning shot. 
        Both arenas demand resilience and a relentless pursuit of improvement, qualities ingrained in me through years of never letting myself 
        be outworked. ">
